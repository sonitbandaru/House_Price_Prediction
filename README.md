# House_Price_Prediction

In this project, I developed an application to predict housing prices using real estate listing descriptions. Utilizing histograms and box plots, I addressed data skewness and handled outliers with Z-score and IQR methods. I applied Natural Language Processing techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency, bag of words, and word embedding to preprocess and convert text into numerical features. By combining text and property features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and area, I trained and evaluated various regression modelsand found that the XGBoost model yielded the best results.

I built a predictive application with it in the Housing_Project_App.py file where the user can input data. This project allowed me to apply machine learning to real estate, converting text insights into useful price predictions.
